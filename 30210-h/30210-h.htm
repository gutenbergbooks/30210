    <h2>
      INTRODUCTION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      English literature has its Comic Histories, its Comic Grammars, its Comic
      Geographies, and its Comic Law-Books, and Carlyle once prophesied that it
      would some day boast its Comic Bible. Tough as the fine old Sage of
      Chelsea was, he predicted this monstrosity with something of the horror a
      barbarian might feel at the thought of some irreverent fellow deliberately
      laughing at the tribal fetish. But what shocked our latter-day prophet so
      greatly in mere anticipation has partially come to pass. "La Bible
      Amusante" has had an extensive sale in France, and the infectious
      irreverence has extended itself to England. Notwithstanding that Mr. G. R.
      Sims, when he saw the first numbers of that abominable publication,
      piously turned up the whites of his eyes, and declared his opinion that no
      English Freethinker, however extreme, would think of reproducing or
      imitating them, there were found persons so utterly abandoned as not to
      scruple at this unparalleled profanity. Several of the French drawings
      were copied with more or less fidelity in the <i>Freethinker</i>, a
      scandalous print, as the Christians love to describe it, which has been
      prosecuted twice for Blasphemy, and whose editor, proprietor and
      publisher, have been punished respectively with twelve, nine and three
      months' imprisonment like common felons, all for the glory and honor of
      God, for the satisfaction of his dear Son, and for the vindication of the
      Holy Spirit. In many cases the French originals could not be reproduced in
      England, owing to their Gallic flavor. A Parisian artist, disporting
      himself among those highly moral histories in the Bible which our youths
      and maidens discover with unerring instinct, was not a spectacle which one
      could dare to exhibit before the pious and chaste British public; any more
      than an English poet could follow the lead of Evariste Parny in his
      "Guerre des Dieux" and "Les Amours de la Bible." But many others were free
      from this objection, and a selection of them served as a basis for the
      Freethinker artist to work on. A few were copied pretty closely; some were
      elaborated and adapted to our national taste; while others furnished a
      central suggestion, which was treated in an independent manner.
      By-and-bye, as the insular diffidence wore off, and the minds of the
      Freethinker staff played freely on the subject, a new departure was taken;
      novel ideas were worked out, and Holy Writ was ransacked for fresh
      comicalities. Dullards prophesied a speedy exhaustion of Bible topics, but
      they did not know how inexhaustible it is in absurdities. Properly read,
      it is the most comical book in the world; and one might say of it, as
      Enobarbus says of Cleopatra, that Age cannot wither it, nor custom stale;
      it's infinite variety.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following Comic Bible Sketches, which will be succeeded in due course
      by others, comprise all those worth preserving that appeared in the
      Freethinker before its editor, proprietor and publisher were imprisoned,
      including the drawings they were prosecuted for by that pious guinea: pig,
      Sir Henry Tyler, who had his dirty fingers severely rapped by Lord
      Coleridge, after spending several hundred pounds of somebody's money in an
      unsuccessful Blasphemy prosecution, in order to patch up his threadbare
      reputation, and perhaps also with a faint hope of cheating the Almighty
      into reserving him a front-seat ticket for the dress-circle in heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      The French Comic Bible prints under each illustration a few crisp lines of
      satiric narrative. This plan has its advantages; it allows, for instance,
      the writer's pen to curvet as well as the artist's pencil. But it is after
      all less effective than the plan we have adopted. We merely give each
      picture a comprehensive and striking title, and print beneath it the Bible
      text which is illustrated. By this means the satire is greatly heightened.
      Not even the sentences of a Voltaire could so illuminate and emphasise the
      grotesqueness of each topic as this juxtaposition of the solemnly absurd
      Scripture with the gaily absurd illustration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same spirit has animated us in designing the pictures. Our object has
      been to take the Bible text always as our basis, to include no feature
      which is contradicted by it, and to introduce as many comicalities and
      anachronisms as possible consistently with this rule. We are therefore
      able to defy criticism. Bibliolators may vituperate us, persecute us, or
      imprison us, but they cannot refute us.. We can safely challenge them to
      prove that a single incident happened otherwise than we have depicted it.
      We can candidly say to them&mdash;"The thing must have happened in some
      way, as to which the Divine Word is silent; this is our view,&mdash;What
      is yours?" And we humbly submit that our speculations are as valid as our
      neighbors'. Nothing but the insanest bigotry in favor of their own
      conjectures could lead them to quarrel with us for expounding ours. If
      they can shame us with explicit disproofs from Holy Writ, let them do so;
      but what right have they to set up their carnal imaginings and uninspired
      theories as the ultimate criteria of truth?
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who object to any employment of satire on "sacred" subjects should
      not go beyond the Preface of this book. It is not for them, nor are they
      for it; and they are warned in the hall of what they must expect in the
      various chambers. But if they neglect the warning they should take the
      responsibility. It will be simply indecent if they turn round afterwards
      and assail us with unmerited abuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the sake of those who proceed in a spirit of impartial candor and
      honest inquiry, we beg to offer a little further explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      We honestly admit that our purpose is to discredit the Bible as the
      infallible word of God. Believing as we do, with Voltaire, that despotism
      can never be abolished without destroying the dogmas on which it rests,
      and that the Bible is the grand source and sanction of them all, we are
      profoundly anxious to expose its pretentions. The educated classes already
      see through them, and the upper classes credit them just as little,
      although they dare not openly profess a scepticism which would imperil
      their privileges. But the multitude are still left to the manipulation of
      priests, credulous victims of the Black Army everywhere arrayed against
      freedom and progress. It is to liberate these from thraldom that we labor,
      sacrifice and suffer. Without being indifferent to what the world calls
      success, we acknowledge the sovereignty of loftier aims. Compared with the
      advancement of Freethought everything else is to us of trivial moment. It
      may interest, and perhaps surprise, some to learn that for the famous
      Christmas Number of the Freethinker which was successfully prosecuted, the
      editor received absolutely nothing for his work except twelve months'
      imprisonment, while the then registered proprietor, who suffered nine
      months of the same fate, actually shared with him a pecuniary loss of five
      pounds. We are really in deadly earnest, like all the greater soldiers of
      freedom who preceded us; and we employ our smaller resources of satire, as
      such giants as Lucian, Rabelais, Erasmus, Voltaire and Heine used theirs,
      for ends that reach far forward into the mighty future, and affect the
      welfare of unimagined generations of mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the masses do not read learned disquisitions; they have no leisure to
      make themselves adequately acquainted with the history of the Bible
      documents; nor can they study comparative religion, trace out the
      analogies between Christianity and older faiths, and realise how all the
      elaborate developments of doctrine and ritual in modern creeds have sprung
      from a few simple beliefs and practices of savage superstition. But they
      are conversant with one or two cardinal ideas of science, and they know
      the principles which underlie our daily life. What is called common sense
      (the logic of common experience) is their philosophy, and whoever seeks to
      move them must appeal to them through that. Strange as it may appear, it
      is that very common sense which the clergy dread far more than all the
      disclosures of learning and all the revelations of science; the reason
      being, that learning and science are the privilege of a few, while common
      sense is the possession of all, and affects the very foundations of
      spiritual and political tyranny.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ridicule is a most potent form of common-sense logic. What is the <i>reductio
      ad absurdum</i> but an appeal to admitted truths against plausible
      falsehoods? Reducing a thing to an absurdity is simply showing its
      inconsistency with what is common to both sides in a dispute; and it
      frequently means the exposure of a gross contradiction to the principles
      of sanity. Laughter, too, as Hobbes pointed out, has always an element of
      pride or contempt; being invariably accompanied by a feeling of
      superiority to its object. Whoever laughs at an absurdity is above it. He
      looks down on it from a loftier altitude than argument can reach. The man
      who laughs is safe. He can never more be in danger, unless he suffers
      fatty degeneration of the heart or fattier degeneration of the head.
      Priestcraft nourishes hope in the scientific laboratory, and feels only
      faint misgivings in academic halls; but it pales and withers at the smile
      of scepticism, and hears in a low laugh the note of the trump of doom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ridicule can never injure truth. What it hurts must be false. Laugh at the
      multiplication-table as much as you please, and twice two will still make
      four.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pictorial ridicule has the immense advantage of visualising absurdities.
      Lazy minds, or those accustomed to regard a subject with the reverence of
      prejudice, read without realising. But the picture supplies the deficiency
      of their imagination, translates words into things, and enables them to
      see what had else been only a vague sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christians read the Bible without realising its wonders, allowing
      themselves to be cheated with words. Mr. Herbert Spencer has remarked that
      the image of the Almighty hand launching worlds into space is very fine
      until you try to form a mental picture of it, when it is found to be
      utterly irrealisable. In the same way, the Creation Story is passable
      until you image the Lord making a clay man and blowing up his nose; or the
      story of Samson until you picture him slaying file after file of
      well-armed soldiers with the jaw-bone of a costermonger's pony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let it be observed that these Comic Bible Sketches ridicule nothing but
      miracles. Mr. Mathew Arnold has said that the Bible miracles are only
      fairy tales (very poor ones, by the way) and their reign is doomed. We
      only seek to hasten their deposition. Whatever the Bible contains of
      truth, goodness and beauty, we prize as well as its blindest devotees. But
      this valuable deposit of antiquity would be more useful if cleared of the
      rubbish of superstition. It is not the good, but the evil parts of the
      Bible, that are supported by its supernaturalism. Why should civilised
      Englishmen go walking about in Hebrew Old-Clothes? Let us heed Carlyle's
      stern monition:&mdash;"The Jew old-clothes having now grown fairly
      pestilential, a poisonous incumbrance in the path of of men, burn them up
      with revolutionary fire."
    </p>
    <p>
      A word in conclusion. The editor of the "Manchester Examiner," writing
      over the well-Known signature of "Verax," recently published a long
      article, censuring the policy of aggressive Freethought, and declaring
      that to laugh at the absurdities of the Bible was to insult the human
      race. We might as well, he said, laugh at our poor ancestors, the ancient
      Britons, for all their mistakes and follies. Well, when the ancient Jews
      are not only dead, but buried like the ancient Britons; when their
      mistakes and follies are no longer palmed off on unsuspecting children,
      and imposed on grown-up men and women, as divine immortal truths; we will
      cease ridiculing them, and devote our attention to worthier objects. What,
      would "Verax" say if an ancient Briton, dressed in a full suit of
      war-paint, were to walk through the Manchester streets, boasting himself
      the pink of fashion, and insulting peaceable citizens who refused to
      patronise his tailor? Would he not write a racy article on the absurd
      phenomenon, and ask why the police tolerated such a nuisance? In like
      manner we publish our Comic Bible Sketches, and summon the police of
      thought to remove those ancient Jews who still infest our mental
      thoroughfares.
